I didn’t wake up one day deciding to create dotfiles.

☐ No master plan<br>
☐ No productivity obsession<br>
☐ No aesthetic flex<br>

It started with curiosity and a quiet wish to make things feel better.

## ◦ What Are Dotfiles? (In Simple Words)
Dotfiles are configuration files.
They decide how your tools behave, look, and respond to you.

They’re called dotfiles because they start with a dot:

∘ .zshrc<br>
∘ .gitconfig<br>
∘ .wezterm. Lua<br>

They are:

◦ Quiet<br>
◦ Hidden<br>
◦ Always working in the background<br>

Once set up, they just… work.

## ◦ How I Discovered Them
At first, I only wanted my terminal to look nicer.

Then came:

◦ a small color tweak<br>
◦ a simple shortcut<br>
◦ a faster way to move around<br>
◦ a clean system info view<br>

And slowly, something clicked:

∘ All these tools were configurable<br>
∘ And all those configs were just files<br>

Plain text.<br>
Editable.<br>
Portable.<br>

That realization changed everything.

## ◦ One Small Change at a Time
I didn’t learn everything at once.<br>

◦ changed one thing<br>
◦ broke it<br>
◦ fixed it<br>
◦ learned something<br>

Nothing was locked behind a UI.
Nothing felt permanent in a scary way.

If something didn’t feel right, I removed it.

That freedom felt really nice.

## ◦ Why Dotfiles Feel So Good
The magic isn’t being “advanced”.

The magic is convenience.

◦ Things are where I expect them to be<br>
◦ Shortcuts work the way my brain works<br>
◦ Tools feel familiar, even on a new machine<br>

No friction.<br>
No relearning.<br>
No noise.<br>

Just calm.

## ◦ What My Dotfiles Cover
Over time, my dotfiles grew naturally.

◦ Terminal & Prompt<br>
∘ WezTerm · Alacritty · Ghostty<br>
∘ Starship<br>

◦ System & Visuals<br>
∘ btop<br>
∘ fastfetch / neofetch<br>
∘ cava<br>

◦ Development<br>
∘ Neovim<br>
∘ Build tools<br>
∘ LaTeX configs<br>

◦ Navigation<br>
∘ Yazi<br>
∘ broot<br>

◦ Productivity<br>
∘ Raycast<br>
∘ wtf<br>
∘ jrnl<br>

◦ Media & Fun<br>
∘ mpv<br>
∘ Games & experiments<br>

Nothing fancy.
Nothing forced.
Just tools, I actually use almost all the time.

## ◦ It Feels Personal (And That Matters)
My setup isn’t perfect.
It isn’t copied from anyone.

It changes when I change.

Some days I remove things.
Some days I add one tiny tweak.

Dotfiles grow with you quietly.

## ◦ Final Thoughts
Dotfiles taught me something simple:

∘ You don’t need to overhaul everything<br>
∘ You just need to care a little<br>

One file.<br>
One change.<br>
One improvement.<br>

Over time, your system stops feeling generic
And starts feeling like home.
