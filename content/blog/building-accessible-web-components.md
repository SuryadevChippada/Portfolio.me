I didn’t wake up one day deciding to create dotfiles.

☐ No master plan
☐ No productivity obsession
☐ No aesthetic flex

It started with curiosity and a quiet wish to make things feel better.

◦ What Are Dotfiles? (In Simple Words)
Dotfiles are configuration files.
They decide how your tools behave, look, and respond to you.

They’re called dotfiles because they start with a dot:

∘ .zshrc
∘ .gitconfig
∘ .wezterm.lua

They are:

◦ Quiet
◦ Hidden
◦ Always working in the background

Once set up, they just… work.

◦ How I Discovered Them
At first, I only wanted my terminal to look nicer.

Then came:

◦ a small color tweak
◦ a simple shortcut
◦ a faster way to move around
◦ a clean system info view

And slowly, something clicked:

∘ All these tools were configurable
∘ And all those configs were just files

Plain text.
Editable.
Portable.

That realization changed everything.

◦ One Small Change at a Time
I didn’t learn everything at once.

◦ changed one thing
◦ broke it
◦ fixed it
◦ learned something

Nothing was locked behind a UI.
Nothing felt permanent in a scary way.

If something didn’t feel right, I removed it.

That freedom felt really nice.

◦ Why Dotfiles Feel So Good
The magic isn’t being “advanced”.

The magic is convenience.

◦ Things are where I expect them to be
◦ Shortcuts work the way my brain works
◦ Tools feel familiar, even on a new machine

No friction.
No relearning.
No noise.

Just calm.

◦ What My Dotfiles Cover
Over time, my dotfiles grew naturally.

◦ Terminal & Prompt
∘ WezTerm · Alacritty · Ghostty
∘ Starship

◦ System & Visuals
∘ btop
∘ fastfetch / neofetch
∘ cava

◦ Development
∘ Neovim
∘ Build tools
∘ LaTeX configs

◦ Navigation
∘ Yazi
∘ broot

◦ Productivity
∘ Raycast
∘ wtf
∘ jrnl

◦ Media & Fun
∘ mpv
∘ Games & experiments

Nothing fancy.
Nothing forced.
Just tools, I actually use almost all the time.

◦ It Feels Personal (And That Matters)
My setup isn’t perfect.
It isn’t copied from anyone.

It changes when I change.

Some days I remove things.
Some days I add one tiny tweak.

Dotfiles grow with you quietly.

◦ Final Thoughts
Dotfiles taught me something simple:

∘ You don’t need to overhaul everything
∘ You just need to care a little

One file.
One change.
One improvement.

Over time, your system stops feeling generic
and starts feeling like home.
